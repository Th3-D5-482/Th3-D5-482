## 📂 GitHub Philosophy

This GitHub profile is a living archive of my development journey.  
You'll find public repositories that reflect my skills, interests, and evolving approach to software design.

I treat each commit as a conversation—with myself, my collaborators, and the future maintainers.  
Code should be expressive, purposeful, and kind to those who inherit it.

Feel free to explore my repositories, peek into my code, and see how I think through problems.  
Whether you're here to collaborate, learn, or just browse—you're always welcome.

> “Software should be built like a good conversation: clear, respectful, and open to change.”
